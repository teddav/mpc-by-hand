# MPC for newbies ðŸ‘¶

If you're new to MPC, there's a lot to learn.  
We're trying here to explain the basics: Oblivious Transfer (OT), Oblivious Linear Evaluation (OLE), Vector Oblivious Linear Evaluation (VOLE)  
And then go a bit further, mixing ZK and MPC with QuickSilver: a zero-knowledge proof protocol that leverages VOLE to achieve efficient proofs.
